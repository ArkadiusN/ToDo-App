## What is ToDo-App

ToDo-APP is a simple todo desktop list application. The initial version was being navigated with the use of command line interface. However, the extension has required to provided a GUI for the application. The format of the interface and code changes in relation to the application were limitless. The only requirement was to create the initial design wire frame by which the development is concluded.

## 1 Getting ToDo-APP

### 1.1 Check if ToDo-APP can be executed

To run the ToDo-APP you need to have installed [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) on your machine.
The version of the JDK to execute this program can start from version _11.0_, however, we encourage to use versions above if necessary.
Check if you have the JDK installed by opening a terminal and typing :

```bash
javac -version
java -version
```

or

```bash
java -version && javac -version
```

In case where a version was given back by the terminal you can execute the code. You should get something similar to the one above except your version might be _11.0_ or above.

After this is done open a terminal and type :
