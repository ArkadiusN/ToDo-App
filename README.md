## What is ToDo-App

ToDo-APP is a simple todo desktop list application. The initial version was being navigated with the use of command line interface. However, the extension has required to provided a GUI for the application. The format of the interface and code changes in relation to the application were limitless. The only requirement was to create the initial design wire frame by which the development is concluded.

## 1 Getting ToDo-APP

### 1.1 Check if ToDo-APP can be executed

To run the ToDo-APP you need to have installed [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) on your machine.
The version of the JDK to execute this program can start from version _11.0_, however, we encourage to use versions above if necessary.
Check if you have the JDK installed by opening a terminal and typing :

```bash
javac -version
java -version
```

or

```bash
java -version && javac -version
```

In case where a version was given back by the terminal you can execute the code. You should get something similar to the one above except your version might be _11.0_ or above.

### 1.2 Execute code in terminal

To execute the code in the terminal, simply navigate to the downloaded folder where the "Main.class" and "Main.java" files are located. Next, copy the path address. Once this is done, open a terminal and type the following command:

```bash
cd "path/address/you/have/copied"
```

confirm with "Enter" and type :

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

On successful completion of going through these steps, you should be able to view the result below :

### 1.3 Execute JAR file in terminal
An alternative option is to simply run JAR file located in the filepath:
```bash
ToDo-App/out/artifacts/part_3_jar/
```
where the JAR file is located at "part3.jar". It is important to note that the JDK configuration must be set up according to the guide or correspond to the current configuration at the time of reading this documentation. Nevertheless, the best options is to run simple command in our terminal:

```bash
cd "path/address/you/have/copied/that/goes/to/jar/file/location"
```
```bash
java -jar part3.jar
```
Upon successful completion, the ToDo-App should be displayed without any error messages.
